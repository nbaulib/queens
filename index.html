      <h1>Affordable Housing in Queens</h1>
      <p>Hillary Pham, Nico Bautista-Libreros, Oliver Tangney, Tesneem Essa <br> Professor Tong Yi | CS 127 | Fall 2022 </p>
      <p class="mb-2">In New York City, there are many affordable housing units and projects. This project aims to examine the number of affordable housing units and their location in four Queens neighborhoods: Astoria, Elmhurst, Flushing, and Jackson Heights.</p>
      <p>The goal of the project was to examine the demography of each neighborhood using data from the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey. Then, we designed rankings based on common desirable features such as cost of living, access to transportation, low crime and safety, etc. Lastly, we analyzed and reported on the number of buildings, units, and projects from the 'Affordable Housing Production by Building' dataset.</p>
